Summary: 
 - Validate the ability to configure a different TCP port than the default 179 for a remote peer. This should be tested for a EBGP as well as IBGP neighborship
 - Ensure that state information on configured transport parameters can be accurately derived.

Topology:
ATE (Port1) <-IBGP-> (Port1) DUT (Port2) <-EBGP-> (Port2) ATE
  - Connect ATE Port1 to DUT port1
  - Connect ATE Port2 to DUT port2

Procedure:
  - Establish IS-IS adjacency between ATE Port1 and DUT Port1. 
  - Establish BGP sessions as follows between ATE and DUT . 
    - ATE port 1 is used for IBGP connection between the Loopback address of the DUT and the IS-IS learnt address behind ATE:Port1. Please ensure that the ATE has BGP listening on a different TCP port than 179 (example: 1800)
    - The DUT has eBGP peering with ATE port 2 and is receiving IPv4/6 routes. Here too for EBGP, ensure that ATE is using a different transport than default 179 (example: 1800).
  - Validate session and transport states on ATE and DUT ports using telemetry.
    - As part of the validation, we should ensure that the values for the leaves "neighbors/neighbor/state/neighbor-port" and "neighbors/neighbor/transport/state/remote-port" are as configured above
    - Ensure that the remote address derived from the leaves, "neighbors/neighbor/state/neighbor-address" and "neighbor/transport/state/remote-address" are as configured for the neighbors
  - Validate session state and capabilities received on DUT using telemetry.
  - Validate the BGP route/path and corresponding attributes for v4 and v6 prefixes
