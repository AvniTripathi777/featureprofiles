# MTU-1.3: Large IP Packet Transmission

## Summary

Test that ports with sufficiently high MTU do not fragment any packets when flows of various size 
IPv4 and IPv6 packet sizes are sent over them.

## Procedure

* Test environment setup
  * Configure DUT with routed input and output interfaces with an Ethernet MTU of 9216.
  * Test should be executed with two different interface/connectivity profiles:
    1) Standalone -- one input and one output port
    2) Bundle with four input members and four output members

* MTU-1.3.1: Test with Physical and Bundle interfaces
  * Run traffic flows of the following size over IPv4 and IPv6 between ATE ports. 
    * 1500 Bytes
    * 2000 Bytes
    * 4000 Bytes
    * 9202 Bytes
  * Assert ATE reports packets sent and received count are the same, indicating no fragmentation, and 
    successful transit.

* MTU-1.3.2: Test w/ tunnel interfaces and forwarding plane via the physical and bundled interfaces
  * Configure DUT with a GRE tunnel interface.
    * Tunnel interface uses /32 tunnel destination and loopback interface as the source of the tunnel.
    * Ensure MTU configured on this interface matches MTU configured on the exit interface.
  * Configure a static route for the tunnel end point destination pointing at an exit interface.
  * Pick 2 different /24 IPv4 and /64 IPv6 subnets each to emulate destination of payload traffic to be tunneled. Note: This is for the destination prefixes of the flows generated by ATE:Port1.
    * Ensure you have static routes in place for the inner header destination to point at the exit interface (Physical/Bundle)
  * Run traffic flows of the following size over IPv4 and IPv6. For each scenario, the MTU configured on the physical/bundle interfaces plus the tunnel interface must be the same.
    * 1500 Bytes
    * 2000 Bytes
    * 4000 Bytes
    * 9202 Bytes
    * 9202 Bytes
  * Assert ATE reports packets sent and received count are the same, indicating no fragmentation, and 
    successful transit.
  * Run the above for GUE tunnel interface
